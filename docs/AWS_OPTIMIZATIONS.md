# AWS Services Efficiency Optimizations

This document outlines the AWS efficiency optimizations implemented to improve performance, reduce costs, and enhance reliability of the WWF (WordSquad) application.

## Infrastructure Optimizations (Terraform)

### S3 & CloudFront
- **Removed deprecated ACL**: Updated S3 bucket to use bucket policy instead of deprecated `acl = "public-read"`
- **Added CloudFront OAI**: Implemented Origin Access Identity for secure S3 access
- **Enhanced caching**: Added compression and optimized TTL settings (1h default, 24h for static assets)
- **Cost optimization**: Limited CloudFront to PriceClass_100 (North America and Europe only)
- **Security**: Updated SSL policy to `ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-2021-06`

### ECS & Load Balancer
- **Auto Scaling**: Added ECS auto scaling with CPU (70%) and memory (80%) targets
- **Health checks**: Optimized ALB health checks with `/health` endpoint and proper timing
- **Connection efficiency**: Reduced ALB idle timeout from 3600s to 60s (98% reduction)
- **Deployment reliability**: Added circuit breaker for better deployment rollbacks
- **Deregistration**: Reduced deregistration delay to 30s for faster scaling

### Lambda & Monitoring
- **Runtime upgrade**: Updated Lambda to Python 3.12 for better performance
- **Log retention**: Reduced CloudWatch log retention from 14 to 7 days for cost savings

## Application Code Optimizations

### Memory Caching
- **Words list caching**: Cache 2310 words in memory instead of reading file on every request
- **Performance**: Eliminates repetitive file I/O operations

### Redis Optimization
- **Connection pooling**: Implemented Redis connection pool with max_connections=20
- **Reliability**: Added retry logic for Redis operations
- **Connection reuse**: Reduces connection overhead

### External API Efficiency
- **Timeout optimization**: Reduced API timeout from 5s to 3s (40% improvement)
- **Faster responses**: Improves user experience for definition lookups

## CI/CD Pipeline Optimizations

### Docker Build Efficiency
- **Eliminated duplicate builds**: Reuse test Docker image instead of rebuilding
- **Faster deployments**: Reduces CI/CD execution time

### CloudFront Invalidation
- **Selective invalidation**: Target specific paths instead of `/*`
- **Cost reduction**: Reduces CloudFront invalidation costs

## Performance Impact

### Before Optimizations
- File I/O on every request for word list (2310 words)
- 5-second timeout for external API calls
- 3600-second ALB idle timeout
- Full CloudFront cache invalidation
- Single Redis connection per request
- Duplicate Docker builds in CI

### After Optimizations
- ✅ Memory-cached word list (zero file I/O)
- ✅ 3-second API timeout (40% faster)
- ✅ 60-second ALB timeout (98% reduction)
- ✅ Selective CloudFront invalidation
- ✅ Connection-pooled Redis (20 max connections)
- ✅ Single Docker build reused in CI

## Cost Savings
- **CloudWatch logs**: 50% reduction in log storage costs
- **ALB connections**: 98% reduction in idle connection time
- **CloudFront**: Reduced invalidation costs and geographic distribution
- **ECS scaling**: Dynamic scaling based on actual load
- **CI/CD**: Faster builds reduce compute costs

## Testing
Added comprehensive test suite (`tests/test_aws_optimizations.py`) to verify:
- Memory caching functionality
- Redis connection pooling
- API timeout optimization
- Health endpoint reliability
- Error handling for missing assets

## Deployment Notes
These optimizations maintain backward compatibility and include:
- Graceful fallbacks for Redis connection failures
- Health checks that properly validate service status
- Auto scaling that prevents over-provisioning
- Circuit breakers for deployment safety

All changes follow infrastructure-as-code principles and can be rolled back if needed.
