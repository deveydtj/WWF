# Responsive Design Conflict Resolution Requirements

## Overview
This document specifies the requirements for resolving CSS rule conflicts and window resize behavior issues in WordSquad's responsive layout system.

## CSS Rule Conflict Resolution

### Consolidated Breakpoint Management
- **Single Source of Truth**: All mobile breakpoint rules (≤600px) consolidated in `responsive.css`
- **File Separation**: Clear separation of concerns between `layout.css` (structural) and `responsive.css` (responsive adaptations)
- **No Duplicates**: Eliminated duplicate media queries and conflicting selectors

### CSS Rule Organization
- **Layout.css Responsibilities**:
  - CSS Grid container structure (`#mainGrid`)
  - Grid area assignments for panels
  - Base panel styles (content styling only, no positioning)
  - Grid template definitions for different screen sizes
  
- **Responsive.css Responsibilities**:
  - Breakpoint-specific grid layouts and template areas
  - Mobile panel positioning overrides (fixed overlays)
  - Viewport-specific panel scaling and spacing

### Removed Conflicts
- **Container Query Conflicts**: Eliminated conflicting `@container` and `@media` rules at same breakpoint
- **Panel Positioning**: Pure CSS Grid positioning - no JavaScript manipulation required
- **Layout Container**: CSS Grid replaces legacy flexbox three-panel container system
- **Absolute Positioning**: Removed all absolute positioning in favor of grid areas

## Window Resize Behavior

### Smooth Transitions
- **Layout Container**: Added `transition: flex-direction 0.3s ease, gap 0.3s ease`
- **Panel Transitions**: Applied `transition: width 0.3s ease, opacity 0.3s ease` to all panels
- **Mode Switching**: Smooth transitions between light (≤600px), medium (601px-900px), and full (>900px) modes

### Dynamic Breakpoint Crossing
- **Validated Scenarios**:
  - Desktop to mobile (1200px → 500px)
  - Mobile to medium (500px → 800px)  
  - Medium to full (800px → 1200px)
  - Gradual resizing across all breakpoints

### CSS Rule Priority
- **Specificity Order**: Media queries ordered from most specific (mobile) to least specific (desktop)
- **Cascade Management**: Clear cascade hierarchy prevents rule conflicts during transitions
- **Transition Compatibility**: All transition properties work correctly across breakpoint changes

## Technical Implementation

### Breakpoint Structure
```css
/* Mobile: ≤600px - All mobile rules in responsive.css */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  /* Grid layout for mobile */
  #mainGrid {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    grid-template-areas: "center";
    gap: 0;
  }
  
  /* Mobile panel positioning as fixed overlays */
  #historyBox, #definitionBox, #chatBox {
    position: fixed; bottom: 0; width: 100%;
    /* Mobile-specific styling */
  }
}

/* Medium: 601px-900px - Tablet grid layout */
@media (min-width: 601px) and (max-width: 900px) {
  #mainGrid {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    grid-template-areas: "center";
  }
  /* Panels as centered overlays */
}

/* Full: >900px - Desktop grid layout */
@media (min-width: 901px) {
  #mainGrid {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 280px 60px minmax(auto, var(--board-width)) 280px 1fr;
    grid-template-areas: 
      ". history stamp center definition ."
      ". history stamp center chat .";
  }
}
```

### Transition System
```css
/* Main grid container with smooth transitions */
#mainGrid {
  transition: grid-template-columns 0.3s ease-in-out, 
              grid-template-areas 0.3s ease-in-out,
              gap 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

/* Panel base styles with transitions */
#historyBox, #definitionBox, #chatBox {
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out, 
              transform 0.3s ease-in-out,
              width 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

/* Panel visibility handled by display property */
body:not(.history-open) #historyBox { display: none; }
body:not(.definition-open) #definitionBox { display: none; }
body:not(.chat-open) #chatBox { display: none; }
```

## Validation Testing

### Breakpoint Testing Matrix
- [x] **Mobile Mode (≤600px)**: Panel fixed overlay behavior, single-column grid layout
- [x] **Medium Mode (601px-900px)**: Tablet grid layout, centered panel overlays
- [x] **Full Mode (>900px)**: Desktop CSS Grid layout with automatic panel positioning
- [x] **Dynamic Resizing**: Smooth grid transitions during window resize

### Console Validation
- [x] **No CSS Conflicts**: No console warnings about conflicting rules
- [x] **Scaling System**: Enhanced scaling works correctly across all breakpoints
- [x] **Performance**: No layout thrashing during resize operations

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
- [x] **Transition Support**: CSS transitions work across major browsers
- [x] **Media Query Support**: Consistent breakpoint behavior
- [x] **CSS Grid Support**: Modern grid layout supported in all target browsers

## Acceptance Criteria

### CSS Rule Conflicts
- [x] All duplicate mobile breakpoints consolidated
- [x] No conflicting selectors targeting same elements at same breakpoints
- [x] Clear file responsibility separation maintained
- [x] Container query conflicts eliminated

### Window Resize Behavior  
- [x] Smooth 0.3s transitions between layout modes
- [x] No visual jumps or glitches during breakpoint crossing
- [x] Panel positioning updates correctly during resize
- [x] Enhanced scaling system remains functional

### Performance
- [x] No console errors or warnings related to CSS conflicts
- [x] Smooth resize performance without layout recalculations
- [x] Efficient CSS cascade without redundant rule processing

## Notes
This document reflects the completed migration from flexbox three-panel layout to CSS Grid. The grid-based system eliminates the need for JavaScript positioning logic and provides automatic, declarative panel positioning through grid areas. All panels now use pure CSS for positioning, with no runtime calculations required.
