# Uniform Button Layout Requirements

## Overview
Standardize the sizing and layout of input elements and buttons in the game UI to create a consistent, visually appealing interface that aligns with the game board dimensions.

## Requirements

### 1. Button Size Consistency
- **Requirement**: Guess button and Reset button MUST be the same size
- **Rationale**: Visual consistency and balanced UI layout
- **Current Issue**: Buttons have different dimensions across various screen sizes

### 2. Total Width Alignment
- **Requirement**: The combined width of Guess Input + Guess Button + Reset Button MUST equal the total width of the game board
- **Rationale**: Create visual harmony between the input controls and the game board
- **Board Width Reference**: Use CSS custom property `--board-width: calc(var(--tile-size) * 5 + var(--tile-gap) * 4)`

### 3. Responsive Behavior
- **Requirement**: Maintain uniform sizing across all responsive breakpoints
- **Breakpoints to Address**:
  - Mobile (max-width: 600px)
  - Small mobile (max-width: 400px, 350px, 300px)  
  - Medium screens (601px - 900px)
  - Large screens (901px - 1199px)
  - Problem range (1200px - 1550px)
  - Very large screens (1551px+)

### 4. Visual Design Consistency
- **Requirement**: Maintain existing neumorphic design style
- **Elements**: Box shadows, border radius, and color schemes must remain consistent
- **Spacing**: Appropriate gaps between input field and buttons

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Custom Properties
- Use `--board-width` as the primary reference for total available width
- Create standardized button dimensions that scale appropriately
- Ensure gap/margin calculations are included in total width

### Distribution Strategy
- **Suggested Distribution**: 
  - Guess Input: ~60-65% of board width
  - Each Button: ~15-20% of board width
  - Gaps: Account for margins/padding in total calculation

### Accessibility Considerations
- Maintain minimum touch target sizes (44px) on mobile devices
- Preserve existing ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Ensure buttons remain easily tappable across all screen sizes

## Acceptance Criteria

### Visual
- [ ] Guess button and Reset button are visually identical in size
- [ ] Total width of input controls matches game board width
- [ ] Layout appears balanced and professional across all screen sizes
- [ ] Existing neumorphic styling is preserved

### Functional  
- [ ] All buttons remain fully functional after styling changes
- [ ] Touch targets meet accessibility guidelines on mobile
- [ ] Layout doesn't break on extreme screen sizes
- [ ] Responsive behavior works correctly across all breakpoints

### Testing
- [ ] Screenshots confirm visual consistency
- [ ] Manual testing on different viewport sizes
- [ ] Validation that existing game functionality is unaffected

## Notes
This requirement addresses the visual inconsistency in the current UI where buttons have different sizes and the input area doesn't align proportionally with the game board width.
